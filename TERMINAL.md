The terminal is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with their computer using text-based commands. One common task you can perform in the terminal is creating files. Using the `touch` command in Linux and macOS, you can easily create an empty file. Simply type `touch filename`, replacing "filename" with your desired file name and extension. For example, running `touch myfile.txt` will create a blank text file called `myfile.txt` in the current directory. This method is quick, efficient, and widely used by developers and system administrators to manage files from the command line.

**Basic Sytax**
```javascript
touch filename
```

***Example***
```javascript
touch app.js
```
